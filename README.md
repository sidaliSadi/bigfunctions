## 🔍️ What is BigFunctions?

BigFunctions is both:

1. **Open-Source BigQuery functions** (💪 hello SQL-superpowers) callable without install from any GCP project
2. **A framework** to define, test, deploy, document and monitor your own BigQuery functions. Features:
    1. 💚 A standard to define BigQuery routines as yaml files be it sql/js/remote UDF or procedures
    2. 💚 `bigfun` **CLI** (Command Line Interface) to test, deploy, document and monitor these BigQuery routines in your project


<br>


## 💡 Why BigFunctions?

BigQuery, with native and remote routines, is really powerful. **BigFunctions take the most of that by offering ready-to-use functions with useful features for data-teams**.

We believe no-one should be reinventing the wheel and open-source is the best way to fight against that. Hey Data-People! Let's share our work, help each other and inspire from each other. 👉 Play and contribute to BigFunctions!

## 👀 Call public BigFunctions without install from you GCP project

All BigFunctions represented by a 'yaml' file in *bigfunctions* folder are automatically deployed in public datasets so that you can call them directly without install from your BigQuery project.

To explore available bigfunctions and to get started, visit **<a href="https://unytics.github.io/bigfunctions/" target="_blank">BigFunctions website</a>**.

<br>


## 🚀 Deploy BigFunctions in your GCP project

You can also deploy any bigfunction in your project! To deploy *my_bigfunction* defined in *bigfunctions/my_bigfunction.yaml* file, simply call:

``` sh
bigfun deploy my_bigfunction
```

Details about `bigfun` command line are given below.

<br>


## 💥 `bigfun` CLI

`bigfun` CLI (command-line-interface) facilitates BigFunctions development, test, deployment, documentation and monitoring.

### Install `bigfun` 🛠️

Clone the repo and from the repo directory run:

``` sh
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

### Use `bigfun` 🔥

``` sh
$ bigfun --help
Usage: bigfun [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  deploy  Deploy BIGFUNCTION
  doc     Generate, serve and publish documentation
  test    Test BIGFUNCTION
```



### Deploy you first function 👨‍💻

> 1. Make sure the `gcloud` command is [installed on your computer](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
> 2. Activate the application-default account with `gcloud auth application-default login`. A browser window should open, and you should be prompted to log into your Google account. Once you've done that, `bigfun` will use your oauth'd credentials to connect to BigQuery through BigQuery python client!
> 3. Get permissions to edit a dataset `DATASET` in a project `PROJECT` and to run BigQuery queries in that project.


You should then be able to deploy the function `is_email_valid` by simply running

```
bigfun deploy PROJECT.DATASET.is_email_valid
```

Test it with 👀 `select PROJECT.DATASET.is_email_valid('paul.marcombes@unytics.io')` !

<br>


### Deploy you first *remote* function ⚡️

*To deploy a **remote** function* (e.g. python function), there are additional requirements *in addition to the ones above*.

> 1. A *Cloud Run* service will be deployed to host the code ([as seen here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/remote-functions)). So you must have [permissions to deploy a *Cloud Run* service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code#permissions_required_to_deploy) in your project `PROJECT`.
> 2. `gcloud` CLI will be used directly to deploy the service (using `gcloud run deploy`). Then, make sure you are logged in with `gcloud` by calling: `gcloud auth login`. A browser window should also open, and you should be prompted to log into your Google account. WARNING: you read correctly: you have to authenticate twice. Once for bigquery python client (to deploy any function including remote as seen above.) and once now to use `gcloud` (to deploy a *Cloud Run* service).
> 3. A *BigQuery Remote Connection* will be created to link BigQuery with the *Cloud Run* service. You then should have permissions to create a remote connection. *[BigQuery Connection Admin](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.connectionAdmin)* or *[BigQuery Admin](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.admin)* roles have these permissions.
> 4. A service account will be automatically created by Google along with the *BigQuery Remote Connection*. BigQuery will use this service account of the remote connection to invoke the *Cloud Run* service. You then must have the permission to authorize this service account to invoke the *Cloud Run* service. This permission is provided in the role *[roles/run.admin](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles)*


You now should be able to deploy `sentiment_score` function by running

```
bigfun deploy PROJECT.DATASET.sentiment_score
```

To make this specific function work, you first must [enable Google Cloud NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/setup#api) in your project `PROJECT`. You can then test it with 👀 `select PROJECT.DATASET.sentiment_score('This is awesome!')` !
